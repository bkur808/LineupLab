    "# **LineupLab**: NBA Matchup Prediction using Transformer Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "This project is part of the final requirement for the **Introduction to Deep Learning** course. The objective is to develop a machine learning model that predicts NBA matchup outcomes based on player lineups and team configurations. \n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging the BallDontLie API, we will retrieve, clean, and process NBA data to create a dataset suitable for training and testing. A transformer-based deep learning model will be implemented using PyTorch to analyze player lineups and generate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "1. **Data Exploration**: Analyze and preprocess NBA data to ensure compatibility with the model.\n",
    "2. **Model Creation**: Build a transformer network to learn relationships between players in a lineup and predict game outcomes.\n",
    "3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiment with learning rate, optimizer, number of epochs, and other hyperparameters to optimize performance.\n",
    "4. **Evaluation and Analysis**: Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, loss, and F1-score. Provide insights into the model's strengths, limitations, and potential improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "- **Transformer Networks**: Leveraging multi-head attention to capture player and team relationships.\n",
    "- **Comprehensive Dataset**: Utilizing player stats, game results, and team information from the BallDontLie API.\n",
    "- **Visualization and Analysis**: Incorporating visual representations of data distributions, training progress, and performance metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will serve as the main documentation for the project, including all steps from data retrieval to model evaluation.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "In this section, we will collect, prepare, and process NBA data using the **BallDontLie API** to build a dataset for training a transformer-based deep learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals and Actions\n",
    "1. **Data Collection**:\n",
    "   - Retrieve detailed NBA game data (2003–2023) using game IDs.\n",
    "   - Collect individual player statistics (e.g., minutes played, offensive and defensive ratings, usage percentages) for each game.\n",
    "   - Extract team information (e.g., home and away team IDs, scores) and player metadata (e.g., names, positions).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Cleaning**:\n",
    "   - Normalize data formats, particularly for time strings (e.g., parsing minutes played).\n",
    "   - Handle missing or incomplete data by assigning default or null values where necessary.\n",
    "   - Rename and standardize column names (e.g., `id` → `game_id`) for consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Parallelized Processing**:\n",
    "   - Implement a **threaded processing solution** to speed up API calls and data extraction.\n",
    "   - Use incremental saving to ensure progress is retained during long data processing tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Dataset Preparation**:\n",
    "   - Combine game-level and player-level statistics into a single dataset.\n",
    "   - Structure the data for model input, including creating columns for the top 12 players (home and away) with their associated metrics.\n",
    "   - Include player positions directly from the API to enhance the feature set for modeling.\n"

    "## **II. Model Creation**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "This section focuses on building a transformer-based deep learning model to predict NBA game outcomes. The model will analyze static player features and dynamically learned embeddings to generate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals\n",
    "1. **Model Architecture**:\n",
    "   - Implement a transformer network using **PyTorch**.\n",
    "   - Use multi-head attention mechanisms to analyze player-to-player and team-to-team relationships.\n",
    "   - Experiment with architectures that include residual connections to enhance model depth and stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Input and Output Design**:\n",
    "   - **Inputs**:\n",
    "     - Static tensors for each team, including player statistics normalized per game.\n",
    "     - Dynamically learned embeddings for PlayerID, PositionID, TeamID, and Season, added at runtime.\n",
    "   - **Outputs**:\n",
    "     - Predict the final scores for the home and away teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Training**:\n",
    "   - Train the model chronologically, using data from past games to predict future ones.\n",
    "   - Define the training loop with appropriate loss functions and optimizers.\n",
    "   - Split data into training, validation, and test sets based on game chronology for temporal consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Steps\n",
    "1. **Set Up Dynamic Embeddings**:\n",
    "   - Initialize embeddings for PlayerID, PositionID, TeamID, and Season, which will be added dynamically to the static tensors at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Combine Static and Dynamic Features**:\n",
    "   - Design a process to concatenate static and dynamic features for each player token during training and inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Define the Transformer Architecture**:\n",
    "   - Specify input dimensions, number of attention heads, and transformer layers.\n",
    "   - Experiment with designs, including multi-head attention blocks and fully connected layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Configure the Training Pipeline**:\n",
    "   - Choose a regression-based loss function (e.g., Mean Squared Error) and an optimizer (e.g., Adam).\n",
    "   - Set hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Initial Testing**:\n",
    "   - Train the model on a subset of the data (e.g., a single season) to validate functionality and debug issues.\n",
    "   - Evaluate performance metrics (e.g., MSE, RMSE) and refine the architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Scaling and Tuning**:\n",
    "   - Train on the full dataset after initial testing.\n",
    "   - Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This section will document the detailed process of creating and implementing the model, highlighting the reasoning behind architectural and design decisions.\n"

    "1. **Experimentation**:\n",
    "   - Test different values for hyperparameters such as:\n",
    "     - Learning rate.\n",
    "     - Number of epochs.\n",
    "     - Optimizer (e.g., Adam, SGD).\n",
    "     - Batch size.\n",
    "     - Number of transformer layers and attention heads.\n",
    "2. **Performance Evaluation**:\n",
    "   - Assess the impact of each hyperparameter on model accuracy, loss, and F1-score.\n",
    "   - Document observations to identify the most effective configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Steps\n",
    "1. **Baseline Configuration**:\n",
    "   - Train the model with default or commonly used hyperparameter values.\n",
    "   - Record baseline performance metrics.\n",
    "2. **Iterative Testing**:\n",
    "   - Adjust one hyperparameter at a time while keeping others constant.\n",
    "   - Monitor changes in performance and identify trends.\n",
    "3. **Optimal Configuration**:\n",
    "   - Combine the best-performing hyperparameters into a final configuration for training the model.\n",

    "### Overview\n",
    "In this section, we evaluate the performance of the transformer-based model using two primary loss metrics and other relevant performance indicators. The focus will be on understanding the model's strengths, limitations, and areas for improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metrics\n",
    "1. **Score Prediction Accuracy**:\n",
    "   - Measure the actual distance between predicted scores and the true game scores (e.g., Mean Squared Error or Mean Absolute Error).\n",
    "   - Assess how well the model captures the scoring trends in games.\n",
    "2. **Winning Outcome Prediction**:\n",
    "   - Evaluate the model's ability to correctly predict the winning team (e.g., Accuracy, F1-score).\n",
    "   - Analyze classification performance using confusion matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals\n",
    "1. **Performance Metrics**:\n",
    "   - Quantify how accurately the model predicts game outcomes and scores.\n",
    "   - Identify patterns or biases in the model’s predictions.\n",
    "2. **Visual Representations**:\n",
    "   - Plot training and validation loss over epochs.\n",
    "   - Generate confusion matrices for winning outcome predictions.\n",
    "   - Visualize score prediction distributions.\n",
    "3. **Strengths and Limitations**:\n",
    "   - Discuss areas where the model performs well and where it struggles.\n",
    "   - Identify real-world scenarios where the model could be applied effectively.\n",
    "4. **Future Improvements**:\n",
    "   - Suggest ways to enhance the model, such as adjusting hyperparameters, adding new features, or increasing dataset size.\n",
