# **LineupLab: NBA Game Prediction with Transformers**  

A transformer-based deep learning model that predicts NBA game outcomes by analyzing player lineups and team configurations.

## **About**  
This project uses PyTorch to build and train transformer networks capable of predicting the final scores for NBA matchups. Player-level statistics and dynamically learned embeddings are integrated to model relationships between players and teams.

## **How to Use**  
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- DATA HAS ALREADY BEEN COLLECTED AND CLEANED - FEEL FREE TO BEGIN FROM SECTION II
- Run through the provided LineupLab **Jupyter Notebook** to:  
   - Explore the data preprocessing steps.  
   - Understand the model architecture and logic.  
   - Reproduce training, validation, and testing processes.

## **Requirements**  
- Python 3.8+  
- PyTorch  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- NBA API Data (from BallDontLie or equivalent)
