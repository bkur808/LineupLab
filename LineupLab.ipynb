    "# LineupLab: NBA Matchup Prediction using Transformer Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "This project is part of the final requirement for the **Introduction to Deep Learning** course. The objective is to develop a machine learning model that predicts NBA matchup outcomes based on player lineups and team configurations. \n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging the BallDontLie API, we will retrieve, clean, and process NBA data to create a dataset suitable for training and testing. A transformer-based deep learning model will be implemented using PyTorch to analyze player lineups and generate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "1. **Data Exploration**: Analyze and preprocess NBA data to ensure compatibility with the model.\n",
    "2. **Model Creation**: Build a transformer network to learn relationships between players in a lineup and predict game outcomes.\n",
    "3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiment with learning rate, optimizer, number of epochs, and other hyperparameters to optimize performance.\n",
    "4. **Evaluation and Analysis**: Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, loss, and F1-score. Provide insights into the model's strengths, limitations, and potential improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "- **Transformer Networks**: Leveraging multi-head attention to capture player and team relationships.\n",
    "- **Comprehensive Dataset**: Utilizing player stats, game results, and team information from the BallDontLie API.\n",
    "- **Visualization and Analysis**: Incorporating visual representations of data distributions, training progress, and performance metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will serve as the main documentation for the project, including all steps from data retrieval to model evaluation.\n"

    "## Data Exploration and Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "The first step in this project is to collect and clean NBA data from the **BallDontLie API**. This involves retrieving player statistics, game results, and team information to create a dataset suitable for training a transformer-based deep learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals\n",
    "1. **Data Collection**: Retrieve comprehensive NBA data, including:\n",
    "   - Player information (e.g., stats, positions, teams).\n",
    "   - Game results and team statistics.\n",
    "   - Lineup configurations and other relevant details.\n",
    "2. **Data Cleaning**: \n",
    "   - Handle missing or inconsistent data.\n",
    "   - Format and preprocess data into a tokenized structure compatible with transformer networks.\n",
    "   - Normalize numerical features for model training.\n",
    "3. **Data Analysis**: Explore the dataset to understand key features, distributions, and relationships between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section will document all steps taken to prepare the data for input into the machine learning model, ensuring it is accurate, complete, and well-structured.\n"
