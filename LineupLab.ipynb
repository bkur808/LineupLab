    "# **LineupLab**: NBA Matchup Prediction using Transformer Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "This project is part of the final requirement for the **Introduction to Deep Learning** course. The objective is to develop a machine learning model that predicts NBA matchup outcomes based on player lineups and team configurations. \n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging the BallDontLie API, we will retrieve, clean, and process NBA data to create a dataset suitable for training and testing. A transformer-based deep learning model will be implemented using PyTorch to analyze player lineups and generate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "1. **Data Exploration**: Analyze and preprocess NBA data to ensure compatibility with the model.\n",
    "2. **Model Creation**: Build a transformer network to learn relationships between players in a lineup and predict game outcomes.\n",
    "3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiment with learning rate, optimizer, number of epochs, and other hyperparameters to optimize performance.\n",
    "4. **Evaluation and Analysis**: Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, loss, and F1-score. Provide insights into the model's strengths, limitations, and potential improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "- **Transformer Networks**: Leveraging multi-head attention to capture player and team relationships.\n",
    "- **Comprehensive Dataset**: Utilizing player stats, game results, and team information from the BallDontLie API.\n",
    "- **Visualization and Analysis**: Incorporating visual representations of data distributions, training progress, and performance metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will serve as the main documentation for the project, including all steps from data retrieval to model evaluation.\n"

    "## **I. Data Exploration and Preparation**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "In this section, we will collect, prepare, and process NBA data using the **BallDontLie API** to build a dataset for training a transformer-based deep learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals and Actions\n",
    "1. **Data Collection**:\n",
    "   - Retrieve detailed NBA game data (2003–2023) using game IDs.\n",
    "   - Collect individual player statistics (e.g., minutes played, offensive and defensive ratings, usage percentages) for each game.\n",
    "   - Extract team information (e.g., home and away team IDs, scores) and player metadata (e.g., names, positions).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Cleaning**:\n",
    "   - Normalize data formats, particularly for time strings (e.g., parsing minutes played).\n",
    "   - Handle missing or incomplete data by assigning default or null values where necessary.\n",
    "   - Rename and standardize column names (e.g., `id` → `game_id`) for consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Parallelized Processing**:\n",
    "   - Implement a **threaded processing solution** to speed up API calls and data extraction.\n",
    "   - Use incremental saving to ensure progress is retained during long data processing tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Dataset Preparation**:\n",
    "   - Combine game-level and player-level statistics into a single dataset.\n",
    "   - Structure the data for model input, including creating columns for the top 12 players (home and away) with their associated metrics.\n",
    "   - Include player positions directly from the API to enhance the feature set for modeling.\n"

    "   - Predict game outcomes (e.g., winners, scores) as outputs.\n",
    "3. **Model Training**:\n",
    "   - Define the training loop, including loss functions and optimizers.\n",
    "   - Split data into training, validation, and test sets for evaluation.\n",
